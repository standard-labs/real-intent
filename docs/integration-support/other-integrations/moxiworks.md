1. Download the CSV file provided by Real Intent.
2. Upload the CSV into the converter tool.
3. Optionally enter a label or tag (e.g. realintent or zip-90210) to add to the **Categories** column.
4. Download the converted CSV file from the tool.
5. In MoxiEngage go to **People → My People → gear (⚙) → Import Outlook CSV**.
6. Upload the converted file and complete the import (max 2,500 contacts per file).
7. To add contacts to a group: in **My People** select the imported contacts → **Add To** → **Groups** → choose the group(s). Groups are assigned after import; the optional label in step 3 only populates the Categories column.
